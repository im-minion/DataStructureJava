Scramble String

        Given a string A, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

        Below is one possible representation of A = “great”:


        great
        /    \
        gr    eat
        / \    /  \
        g   r  e   at
        / \
        a   t

        To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

        For example, if we choose the node “gr” and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string “rgeat”.

        rgeat
        /    \
        rg    eat
        / \    /  \
        r   g  e   at
        / \
        a   t
        We say that “rgeat” is a scrambled string of “great”.

        Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes “eat” and “at”, it produces a scrambled string “rgtae”.

        rgtae
        /    \
        rg    tae
        / \    /  \
        r   g  ta  e
        / \
        t   a
        We say that “rgtae” is a scrambled string of “great”.



        Given two strings A and B of the same length, determine if B is a scrambled string of S.



        Input Format:

        The first argument of input contains a string A.
        The second argument of input contains a string B.
        Output Format:

        Return an integer, 0 or 1:
        => 0 : False
        => 1 : True*/
