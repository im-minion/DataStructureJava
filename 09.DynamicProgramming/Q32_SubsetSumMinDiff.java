Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum
Difficulty Level : Hard
Last Updated : 26 Oct, 2020
Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements,
Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
Example:

Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5}
Output: 1
Explanation:
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
